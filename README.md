# Rapid-prototyping protection schemes with IEC 61850 #

The goal of this software is to automatically generate C/C++ code which reads and writes GOOSE and Sampled Value packets. Any valid IEC 61850 Substation Configuration Description (SCD) file, describing GOOSE and/or SV communications, can be used as the input. The output code is lightweight and platform-independent, so it can run on a variety of devices, including low-cost microcontrollers. It's ideal for rapid-prototyping new protection and control systems that require communications.

*The code is meant to be a proof of concept, and is highly experimental. It has not been tested on many SCD files.*


## Installation ##

The software requires Eclipse, with the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). Java Emitter Templates (JET) is also required. It's easiest to start with the version of Eclipse that comes with the Modeling Tools bundle (see here: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

There are two source code trees: `emf` (in Java), and `c` (obviously written in C). Each should be a separate project in Eclipse. The Java `emf` project directory is organised as follows:

 - `src/`
   - `sclToC/`: code that does the bulk of the conversion from an SCD file to C code. The class `SCLCodeGenerator` contains the `main()` function for the project.
   - `sclToCHelper/`: helper classes that are generated by JET.
   - `ch/`: the EMF Java model implementation. These files are all automatically generated by EMF, but are included in the repo for convenience.
 - `model/`: the IEC 61850 XML Schema files. EMF uses these to generate the model.
 - `templates/`: the template source files used by JET.

### EMF import process ###

 1. Create an "EMF Project" called "emf", at the location of the repository code.
 2. Select "XML Schema" as the Model Importer type. Select all the IEC 61850 XML Schema documents in the `emf/model` directory.
 3. Select the three root packages that are imported (although, only `scl` is used).
 4. Create a new project of type "Convert Projects to JET Projects", and select the `emf` project. For the `emf` project, go to Project Properties > JET Settings, and set Template Containers to "templates", and Source Container to "src". Delete the `sclToCHelper` directory in the root of `emf` that was created before JET was configured correctly.
 5. Open `SCL.genmodel` and right-click on the root of the model tree. Select "Show Properties View" and ensure that "Compliance Level" is set to "6.0". Right-click on the root again and select "Generate Model Code". This should re-generate the model implementation files, and set up the project properly for using the generated code.

### C code project example ###

An example SCD file and a `main.c` file are provided. Many of the other C files are generated automatically. For the C code to compile on Windows, you should have MinGW installed and add `C:\MinGW\bin;` to `PATH` in the Project Properties > C/C++ Build > Environment options. (Other compilers should work too.) In Project Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings > GCC Compiler Includes, set `"${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/Include}"` as an include path. Also, in Project Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings > MinGW C Linker, add `wpcap` and `ws2_32` to "Libraries" and add `"${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/Lib}"` and `"C:\MinGW\lib"` to "Library search path". The WinPcap library files and header files (from http://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm) have been included in the repository for convenience; the PC must also have WinPcap driver installed (from http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm).

The accompanying mbed microcontroller example code is available [here](http://mbed.org/users/sblair/programs/rapid61850example/lyox9z). A [Processing](http://processing.org/) GUI is located in the `/processing/PACWorldClient` directory. For this to work, execute the example C project, start the microcontroller code, then start the Processing executable.


## Using the code ##

First open the file `SCLCodeGenerator.java`. In the `main()` function, set the variable `xmlFile` to the path of the SCD file. Run the Java project to generate the C implementation.

A basic C `main()` function will look something like:

```C
int length = 0;
unsigned char buffer[2048] = {0};

int main() {
	initialise_iec61850();											// initialise all data structures

	// send GOOSE packet
	PC_IED4.P1.CTRL.OUT_GGIO_1.SPCSO.stVal = TRUE;					// set a value that appears in the "GOOSE_outputs" Dataset
	length = gse_send_GOOSE_outputs_control_GT1(buffer, 1, 512);	// generate a goose packet, and store the bytes in "buffer"
	send_ethernet_packet(buffer, length);							// platform-specific call to send an Ethernet packet

	// receive GOOSE or SV packet
	length = recv_ethernet_packet(buffer);							// platform-specific call to receive an Ethernet packet
	gse_sv_packet_filter(buffer, length);							// deals with any GOOSE or SV dataset that is able to be processed
	boolean inputValue = IED_B.P1.CTRL.B_IN_GGIO_1.gse_inputs.PC_IED4_CTRL_OUT_stVal_1;		// read value that was updated by the packet

	return 0;
}
```

Clearly, a real implementation might include the use of platform-specific timers, interrupts and callbacks, where needed.

### Callbacks after a dataset is decoded ###

Callbacks should be set up in the form:

```C
void callbackFunction() {
	;
}

SyckResult_SynChk.datasetDecodeDone = &callbackFunction;
```

where `SyckResult_SynChk` is of type `struct gseData` or `struct svData`, as defined in gse.h or sv.h. After being initialised, this function will be called after a dataset is successfully decoded, to allow the LN to deal with the new data.

## Known issues and possible features ##

 - only include items in SV packets if set to true in SmvOpts; see page 83 of 61850-6

 - Inputs - find ExtRef DA satisfied by container DO within a dataset, where the DA is not explicitly in a dataset

 - default values (including DOI and DAI), and allocate memory for strings
    - typical values are set in DataTypeTemplates section (DA and BDA, both sub-types of AbstractDataType, may have Val elements)
    - special case values are set in LN definition

 - ensure all dataset elements are in the same order as in the SCD
 - ensure all data types in C code are in an order that can be compiled
 - ensure C string literals are "safe", i.e. `\\` instead of `\`

 - put svData and gseData instances inside LLN0 definition

 - need way of specifying implemented IED, and generating only this IED. But keep existing mode - may be useful for simulating an entire substation
    - i.e., two modes of use.
    - could create a virtual Ethernet bus where all generated packets are broadcast to all IEDs/AccessPoints

 - platform-specific optimisation of the generic byte copy functions
